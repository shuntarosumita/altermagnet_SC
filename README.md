# altermagnet_SC
Code implementation for the analyses of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductivity in an altermagnets, which includes
- Ginzburg-Landau: numerically calculating the Ginzburg-Landau coefficients,
- mean_field: solving the mean-field equation and calculating the free energy,
- Hubbard: analyzing a linearized Eliashberg equation based on a random phase approximation. (For the reduction of Matsubara frequencies, [SparseIR.jl](https://github.com/SpM-lab/SparseIR.jl/tree/main) package is used in the code.)

Details on the method and results can be found in S. Sumita, M. Naka, and H. Seo, [arXiv:2506.*****](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.*****).
