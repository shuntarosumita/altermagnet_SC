# altermagnet_SC
Code implementation of a random phase approximation and a linearized Eliashberg equation, which searches for Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductivity in an altermagnetic state of a two-sublattice square lattice model. For the reduction of Matsubara frequencies, [SparseIR.jl](https://github.com/SpM-lab/SparseIR.jl/tree/main) package is used in the code.

Details on the method and results can be found in S. Sumita, M. Naka, and H. Seo, [arXiv:2506.*****](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.*****).
